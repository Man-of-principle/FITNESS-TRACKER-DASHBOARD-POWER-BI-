 ## Fitness Tracker Dashboard


 Proud to Present: My Latest Fitness Tracker Dashboard! 🏋️‍♂️

I'm excited to share my recent project—a fitness tracker dashboard designed with a modern, app-like interface inspired by the Neumorphism trend. This dashboard combines functionality with a visually appealing design to enhance user experience.

Here’s what makes it stand out:

👋 **Dynamic Welcome Message**: The dashboard greets you with a tailored message based on the time of day, adding a bit of personalization to your experience.

📊 **KPI Cards**: Key metrics are presented in clear, easy-to-read cards, offering a quick overview of your fitness progress.

🎛️**Interactive Slicers:** Switch between different users effortlessly with slicers that allow you to view data from various perspectives, making it easier to track multiple users.

🖼️ **User Images:** Personalized user images, sourced from Unsplash, add a custom touch to the dashboard, making it more engaging.

🎨 **Neumorphism Background:** The soft, minimalist design of the background was created using PowerPoint, giving the dashboard a sleek, modern look that's both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

The dataset was sourced from **datatraining.io**, ensuring the data is reliable and relevant.
